## macOS Users

At the time of writing (June 2020), Google Chrome's browser notifications work intermittently with macOS Catalina.

To ensure you receive browser notifications, you need to follow [these steps](https://crankwheel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009961499-macOS-Catalina-not-getting-desktop-notifications#:~:text=Search%20for%20%22Enable%20native%20notifications,than%20you%20are%20used%20to.):

1. Open a new browser tab in Google Chrome
2. Type in ```chrome://flags/``` and hit Enter
3. Search for *"Enable native notifications"* and in the drop-down menu next to it, select *"Disabled"*. This will prompt you to restart Chrome. Go ahead and do so.
4. Restart Chrome and now, you should get notifications on your desktop, although they will be in a slightly different style than you are used to.
